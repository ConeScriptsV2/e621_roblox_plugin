# E621 Roblox Plugin

**Disclaimer: This plugin for roblox is 18+ because e621 features safe for work and not safe for work material.**

# How it works

You run a program that barely takes up any CPU or Memory usage, then roblox talks with the localhost. It uses e621's API to directly call it from roblox studio, then ask the localhost to download these files and allow roblox studio to use them via rbxasset://.

# How to download

If im not dumb, then you can hit releases and download the plugin and exe file. If you dont see that, just download source code.

# Few more disclaimers

**This is not malware or a trojan.** The source code is available for you to directly check yourselves. The only purpose is for communication between roblox studio and file writing. (Limited to only your roblox studio files)

# How to check source?

Drag and drop the roblox plugin into any game. (Studio of course)

For the localhoster, it is directly featured as a visual studio project. (C#)

# Required to run:
Net 8.0 (Until i make it run on 4.8)

Access to e621 directly (https://e621.net)
